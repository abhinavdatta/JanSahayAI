<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<h3>JanSahayAI</h3>
 <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Citizens across Bharat miss government benefits because information is complex, scattered, and hard to understand.<br>

<h2>2. Target Audience</h2>
<b>Primary Users:</b> Rural citizens, small and marginal farmers, elderly citizens, and daily-wage workers.<br>

<b>User Constraints:</b> Low literacy levels and limited digital skills.<br>

<h2>3. Functional Requirements</h2>
<h3>3.1. Interaction & Interface</h3>
<br><strong>FR-01 (Voice-First):</strong> The solution must prioritize voice interaction, allowing users to "speak, don't type."
<br><strong>FR-02 (Local Language):</strong> Support for regional languages (specifically Telugu and Hindi) for both input and output.

<br><strong> NFR-02 (Device Compatibility):</strong> Must function on basic smartphones and feature phones.
<br><strong>NFR-03 (Privacy & Ethics):</strong> Ensure user-consented interactions with no misuse or selling of personal data.
<br><strong>NFR-04 (Accuracy):</strong> AI responses must be verified against official sources to avoid misinformation.
<br><strong>NFR-05 (Scalability):</strong> Designed to expand across districts/states and support more languages in the future.

<h2>5. Implementation Constraints</h2>
<br><strong>Timeline: Development and deployment timeline is 6 to 8 months.
